/* This is a smaller implementation of printf-family of functions,
 * based on tinyprintf code by Kustaa Nyholm.
 * The formats supported by this implementation are:
 *     'd' 'u' 'c' 's' 'x' 'X' 'p'.
 * Zero padding and field width are also supported.
 * If the library is compiled with 'PRINTF_SUPPORT_LONG' defined then the
 * long specifier is also supported.
 * Otherwise it is ignored, so on 32 bit platforms there is no point to use
 * PRINTF_SUPPORT_LONG because int == long.
